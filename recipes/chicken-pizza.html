        <p>
            Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking. 
            Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbecue chicken is always a crowd pleaser!

            The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like ('That looks like America!'). 
            For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.
