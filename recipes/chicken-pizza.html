        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an appetizer while the ribs are cooking. 
            Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbecue chicken is always a crowd pleaser!
        </p>
        <p>
            The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like ('That looks like America!'). 
            For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul style="text-align: left;"">
            <li>1 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
            <li>Â½ cup barbecue sauce, divided</li>
            <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>cup diced tomatoes, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles. Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up, about 5 minutes. 
                Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spread the remaining barbecue sauce over each crust; top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
